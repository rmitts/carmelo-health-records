# Carmelo's Health Dashboard

This project is a static web-based health dashboard for Carmelo, a 15-year-old mixed-breed canine. It consolidates his critical health metrics, medical history, and a series of comprehensive nutritional and clinical analyses generated by various Large Language Models (LLMs).

The primary purpose of this dashboard is to serve as a centralized, easy-to-navigate repository of Carmelo's health information, providing a clear and detailed overview for his caregivers and veterinary team.

## Technology Stack

The dashboard is built with simple, modern web technologies:

*   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web pages.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the user interface. The utility-first framework is used via a CDN script, making the project self-contained and easy to run without any build steps.
*   **JavaScript**: For minor interactive elements like mobile navigation and accordion sections.

## How to View the Dashboard

To view the dashboard, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No local server or dependencies are required.

```bash
# For macOS
open index.html

# For Windows
start index.html

# For Linux
xdg-open index.html
```

## Content Overview

The dashboard is organized into several key pages:

### 1. **Home (`index.html`)**

The main landing page provides a high-level summary of Carmelo's condition and serves as the primary navigation hub. It features cards that link to the more detailed reports below.

### 2. **Health Overview (`health-overview.html`)**

This page presents a "at-a-glance" view of Carmelo's most critical health data. Key features include:
*   **Critical Metrics**: Highlights abnormal values from his bloodwork, such as kidney (BUN, Creatinine) and liver (ALT, ALP) function indicators.
*   **Action Items**: A clear, prioritized list of actions required for his care.
*   **Monitoring Schedule**: A recommended schedule for future check-ups and tests.

### 3. **AI-Generated Clinical Reports**

A core feature of this project is the inclusion of detailed clinical nutrition reports generated by three different LLMs. These reports analyze Carmelo's bloodwork in the context of his age, breed, and medical history to provide evidence-based dietary recommendations.

*   **Gemini Report (`clinical-nutrition-report.html`)**: A deeply scientific and structured report that provides a comprehensive analysis of Carmelo's health data, discusses dietary principles for managing renal and hepatic stress, and offers a synthesized, actionable plan.
*   **Claude Report (`melo-claude-report.html`)**: Another in-depth report that methodically breaks down the clinical data, dietary principles, and co-occurring conditions. It features extensive (mock) citations and a clear, synthesized nutritional strategy.
*   **ChatGPT Report (`chatgpt-report.html`)**: This report is structured as a user-friendly FAQ, with accordion sections that address common questions about managing a diet for a dog with kidney and liver issues. It covers topics like protein, phosphorus, fats, and safe treats in an accessible format.
